[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jamian20/Student-Mental-Health-EDA-Pandas-Seaborn/blob/main/Student_Mental_Health_Analysis.ipynb)

## Project Overview

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focused on understanding the relationship between student lifestyle factors (screen time, sleep, physical activity) and self-reported mental health and academic changes during online learning.

It serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate proficiency in core Python data science libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Repository Contents

| File/Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Student Mental Health Analysis.ipynb`** | The primary analysis document containing all code, visualizations, and narrative. This is the best place to start. |
| **`Student Mental Health Analysis During Online Learning.csv`** | The dataset used for the analysis. |
| **`Images`** | Directory containing the key saved visualizations (e.g., `correlation_heatmap.png`). |

## Skills Demonstrated

| Library | Key Skills |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pandas** | Data loading, cleaning, standardization, feature transformation (Label Encoding), and correlation matrix generation. |
| **NumPy** | Implicitly used for high-performance numerical operations and statistical computations. |
| **Seaborn & Matplotlib** | Creating advanced statistical visualizations (box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps) and custom axis limits for comparative analysis. |
| **EDA Principles** | Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to derive actionable insights from complex data. |

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several significant relationships in the dataset:

1.  **Physical Activity is Protective:** Students reporting a Low Stress level exhibit significantly higher median weekly physical activity compared to students reporting Medium or High stress.
2.  **Screen Time Impact:** There is a strong negative correlation between screen time and academics. Students whose academic performance Declined recorded the highest average screen time (approx. 7.5 hours/day).
3.  **Digital Health Risk:** Multivariate analysis showed that students with High stress levels often cluster in the quadrant defined by high screen time and low sleep duration, highlighting a key digital health risk factor.
